# 30 days positivity challenge

## Day 1 - Things no one can do as well as me

1. Drawing
2. Taking pictures

I wouldn't say that I work hard because when I train those skills it doesn't feel like working and also because the reward of watching the outcome makes me really happy, it's some of those things where I don't need the judgements of others to know what's the value of my work.

Many people have praised me for my drawings, quite some also for the pictures that I shot.

When I do it, I am totally focused, nothing else matter. That feeling is relaxing, I forget everything good or bad and just look at my paper or my camera.

## Day 2 - Biggest achievements of my life

1. My latest drawing
2. Finishing The London Winter Run - 10k
3. Studying Chinese for 2 years
4. My current situation (Girlfriend, appartement, job,...)
5. Gettin my IT-diploma
6. Fighting my anxiety
7. Taking the airplane even with the fear of flying
8. Growing my own vegetables
9. Being 2nd at one ESL tournament (videogames)
10. Doing the Dalton Terror (Free fall attraction)

## Day 3 - Watch the video
