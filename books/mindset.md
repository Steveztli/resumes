# Mindset

## Resume
There are two mindsets:
- Fixed mindset: people think that their abilities are fixed and can't be improved
- Growth mindset: people believe that their abilities can be grow through work and training

People can have different mindset depending on the ability, for example many people think that they can't draw or can't become leaders.

## The mindsets
People with a growth mindset are solution oriented: for every failure, there's a solution that you have to work for. Blaming yourself won't solve anything. They stretch themselves when it's not going well.

Don't judge people on their skill, help them to learn if they need.

>Think about how to stretch/challenge myself

## Inside the mindsets

#### Learning from failures

The outcome does not qualify your efforts: fail or success. A failure can turn into a future success, what matters is to not give up after failures.
Learning > the outcome

A fixed mindset transforms an action to an identity `fail → I'm a failure`

Don't deny your mistakes, admit them. That's how you can go forward. Being corrected on a mistake is a way to learn


#### Work for it
If there's something that you really want it, you have to work for it and if you work hard enough, you will achieve it.

Never rely on past successes, for example an athlete can get a gold medal once, that doesn not make him having a successful career or life.

When you are sad or feel depressed, the best way to go over it, is to learn something that you always wanted to do and never did, plan it!
> What do I wanna learn and never started?

Avoid being lazy and tired when it becomes to be hard, that's when you learn the most.

#### Abilities
Some people perform better without any learning but after training everyone can reach and beat the talented people.
With training you can also become better than the well-born and trained ones.


## Praising people 
Praise people for the hard work not for their talent.
Eg: `It's fantastic what you have accomplished by training at this` instead of `Ỳou are so good at this` 

Why? Praising people on their talent make them feel the fear of failing and it leads people to refuses challenges because they do not want to be challenged on their abilities and lose value if they fail the challenge.
Praising people for their hard work, motivate them to work even harder and it removes any judgement on their abilities.

Instead of `He's smarted` say
- `He experienced more`
- `He tried harder`
- `He had a better strategy`
- ...

We are used to only see the outcomes but not the hard work behind every success.
If you think about the athletes we only see them on television at the Olympic games and we praise them for winning medals but we actually never show the hard work that they have put to be there.

## Growth mindset at work

Having a growth mindset implies:
- admitting your errors
- being self-efface
- don't undermining 
- not taking credit
  
_-> page 110 - 112_

People like to use the skills that they already have because that gives them fast results and we are not used to learn and give ourself time to learn a new skill.

Elitism is a fixed mindset, you don't believe in the development of others:
- it's about judging. It destroyes innovation and results in pleasing the boos
- Self-importance because it leads to no make progress and not accepting feedback
- Elitists target the people they fear, the comptent people to save their own competences.

Instead mentor people, don't put too much faith in talent. It's also by believing in growth that you can have discussions and start learning.

Show people their progress in learning. 
Try to see learning as a plain field where you need to build a city.


## Feedback 

Ask specific feedback.
Give feedback that promotes learning.

## Parenting

Humans mimic behavior even from a young age, pay attention to your words.
