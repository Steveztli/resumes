# Meditations


## Book 2

>So none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor i can feel angry at my relative or hate him. We are born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

> You are an old man. Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against the fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.

> Concentrate every minute like a Roman on what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing youself from all other distractions. Yes, you can, if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.

>The present is the same for everyone, its loss is the same for everyone, and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can't lose either the past or the future, how could you lose  what you don't have?

> The human soul degrades itself :
> 1) When it is detached from the worl, when it does secession from Nature
> 2) When it turns its back on another person, or sets out to do it harm.
> 3) When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain
> 4) When it says something artificial or false
> 5) When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be randome and disconnected.

>It doesn't hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It's a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil

## Book 3

> Don't waste the rest of your time here worrying about the other people, unless if affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. [...] and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind.

> If you find that there's nothing more important or valuable than that... then don't make room for anything but it, for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours.

> Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too, ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth.
