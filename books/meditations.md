# Meditations


## Book 2

>So none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor i can feel angry at my relative or hate him. We are born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

> You are an old man. Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against the fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.

> Concentrate every minute like a Roman on what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing youself from all other distractions. Yes, you can, if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.

>The present is the same for everyone, its loss is the same for everyone, and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can't lose either the past or the future, how could you lose  what you don't have?

> The human soul degrades itself :
> 1) When it is detached from the worl, when it does secession from Nature
> 2) When it turns its back on another person, or sets out to do it harm.
> 3) When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain
> 4) When it says something artificial or false
> 5) When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be randome and disconnected.

>It doesn't hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It's a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil

## Book 3

> Don't waste the rest of your time here worrying about the other people, unless if affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. [...] and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind.

> If you find that there's nothing more important or valuable than that... then don't make room for anything but it, for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours.

> Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too, ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth.

## Book 4

> Everthing you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you've already seen. "The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception."

> Choose not to be harmed - and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed - and you haven't been.

> Beautigul things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Prais is extraneous. The obkect of praise remains what it was - no better and no worse.

> "If you seek tranquility, do less". Or more accurately do what's essential. Which brings double satisfaction: to do less, better.
> Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary?"

> Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow, or the day after. Unless you were a complete coward, you wouldn't kick up a fuss about which day it was - what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.

> To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.

> So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.

## Book 5

> Nothing happens to anyone that he can't endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharme-out of sher obliviousness or because they want to display "character". Is wisdow really so much weaker than ignorance and vanity?

> In a sence, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them.
> But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us - like sun, wind, animals. Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. THe mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. 
> The impediment to action advances action.
> What stand in the way becomes the way.

> Don't be irritated at people's smell or bad breath. What's the point? With that mouth, with those armpits, they're going to produce that odor.
> But they have a brain! Can't they figure it out? Can't they recognize the problem?
> So you have a brain as well. Good for you. Then use your logic to awaken his. Show him. Make him realize it. If he'll listen, then you'll have solved the problem. Without anger.

> Have you gorgotten what's what?
> - I know, but it was important to them.
> And so you have to be an idiot as well?

## Book 6

> The mind is that which is roused and directed by itself. It makes of itself what is chooses. It makes what it chooses of its own experience.

> The way people behave. THey refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity - people they've never met and never will- that's what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset at not being a hero to your great-grandfather.

> Not to assume it's impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it's humanly possible, you can do it too.

> If anyone can refute me - show me I'm making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective - I'll gladbly change. It's the truth I'm aftern abd the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.

> Awaken, return to yourself. Now, no longer asleep, knowing they were only dreams, clear-headed again, treat everything around you as a dream.

> Nothing has meaning to my mind except its own actions. Which are withint its own control. And it's only the immediate one that matter. Its past and future actions too are meaningless.

> It's normal to feel pain in your hands and feet, if you're using your feet as feet and your hands as hands. And for a human being to feel stress is normal - if he's living a normal human life.
> And if it's normal, how can it be bad?

> You take things you don't control and define them as "good" or "bad". And so of course when the "bad" things happen, or the "good" ones don"t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible- or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited "good" and "bad" to our own actions, we'd have no call to challenge God, or traet other people as enemies.

> Does the sun try to do the rain's work? Or Asclepus Demeter's?
> And what about each of the stars - different, yet working in common?

> It doesn't bother you that you weight only x or y pounds and not three hundred. Why should it bother you that you have only x or y years to live and not more? You accept the limits placed on your body. Accept those placed on your time.

> Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do.
> Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you.
> Sanity means tying it to your own actions.

> Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.

> What injures the hive injures the bee.

> If the crew talked back to the captain, or patients to their doctor, then whose authority would they accept? How could the passengers be kept safe of the patient healthy?

> No one can keep you from living as your nature requires. Nothing can happen to you that is not required by Nature.

## Book 7

> Surrounded as we are by all of this, we need to practice acceptance. Without disdain. But remembering that our own worth is measured by what we devote our energy to.

> Focus on what is said when you speak and on what results from each action. Know what the one aims at, and what the other means.

> No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purplr repeating itself, "No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished."

> When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand thant, you'll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they're misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?

> Discard your misperceptions.
> Stop being jerked like a puppet.
> Limit yourself to the present.
> Understand what happens - to you, to others.
> Analyze what exists, break it all down: material and cause.
> Anticipate your final hours.
> Other people's mistakes? Leave them to their makers.

> And why should we feel anger at the world?
> As if the world would notice.

> Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
> - to accept this event with humility
> - to treat this person as he should be treated
> - to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.

> Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.

> Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense.

## Book 8

> For every action, ask: How does it affect me? Could I change my mind about it?

> If it's in your control, why do you do it? If it's in someone else's, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.
Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can't do that either. Then where does blaming people get you?
No pointless actions.

> You could be good today, but instead you choose tomorrow.

> External things are not the problem. It's your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.
If the problem is something in your own character, who's stopping you from setting your mind straight?
And if it's that you're not doing something you think you should be, why not just do it?
But there are insuperable obstacles. 
Then it's not a problem. The caus of your inaction lies outside you.
But how can I go on living with that undone?
Then depart, with a good conscience, as if you'd done it, embracing the obstacle.

> What doesn't transmit light creates its own darkness.

## Book 9

> Leave other people's mistales where they lie.

> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind, things that eist only there, and clear out space for youself.

## Book 10

> Everything that happen is either edurable or not.
> If it's endurable, then endur it. Stop complaining.
> If it's unendurable... then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well.
> Just remembr: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.
> In your interest, or in your nature.

> If they've made a mistake correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can't do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one.

> To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.

> Stop whatever you're doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won't be able to do this anymore?

> When faced with people's bad behavior, turn around and ask when you have acted like that. When you saw money as good, or pleasure, or social position. Your anger will subside as soon as you recongnize that they acted under compulsion (what else could they do?)
> Or remove the compulsion, if you can.

> Learn to ask of all actions, "Why are they doing that?"
> Starting with your own.

## Book 11

> As you move forward in the logos, people will stand in your way. They can't keep you from doing what's healthy, don't let them stop you from putting up with them either. Take care on both counts. Not just sound jedgements, solid actions - tolerance a well, for those who try to obstruct us or give us trouble in other ways.
> Becaus anger, too, is weakness, as much as breaking down and giving up the struggle. Both are deserters: the man who breaks and runs, and the one who lets himself be alienated from his fellow humans.

> Fout habits of thought to watch for, and erase from your mind when you catch them. Tell youself:
> - This thought is unnecessary
> - This one is destructive to the people around you
> - This wouldn't be what you really think (to say what you don't think - the definition of absurdity)
> And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more divine part of you u has been beaten and subdued by the degraded mortal part - the body and its stupid self-indulgence.

> "If you don't have a consistent goal in life, you can't live it in a consistent way".
> Unhelpful, unless you specify a goal.
> There is no common benchmark for all the things that the people think are good - except for few, the ones that affect us all. So the goal should be a common one - a civic one. If you direct all your energies toward that, your actions will be consistent. And so will you.

## Book 12

> It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god appeared to us - or a wise human being, even - and prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or imagining anything wihout immedialety shouting it out, we wouldn't make it through a single day. That's how mch we value other people's opinions - instead of our own.

> It's time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.
> What's in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jaleousy? Desire? Feelings like that?

> To undertake nothing:
> at random or without purpose;
> for any reason but the common good.

> That before long you'll be no one, and nowhere. Like all the things you see now. All the people now living.
> Everything's destiny is to change, to be transformed, to perish. 
> So that new things can be born.

> To be angry at something means you've forgotten:
>  That everything that happens is natural.
>  That the responsability is theirs, not yours.
> And further...
>  That whatever happens has always happened, and always will, and is happening at this very moment, everywhere. Just like this.
>  What links one human being to all humans: not blood, or birth, but mind.
> And...
> That an individual's mind is God and of God.
> That nothing belongs to anyone. Children, body, life itself - all of them come from that same source.
> That it's all how you choose to see things.
> That the present is all we have to live in. Or to lose
