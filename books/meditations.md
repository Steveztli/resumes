# Meditations


## Book 2

>So none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor i can feel angry at my relative or hate him. We are born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

> You are an old man. Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against the fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.

> Concentrate every minute like a Roman on what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing youself from all other distractions. Yes, you can, if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.

>The present is the same for everyone, its loss is the same for everyone, and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can't lose either the past or the future, how could you lose  what you don't have?

> The human soul degrades itself :
> 1) When it is detached from the worl, when it does secession from Nature
> 2) When it turns its back on another person, or sets out to do it harm.
> 3) When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain
> 4) When it says something artificial or false
> 5) When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be randome and disconnected.

>It doesn't hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It's a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil

## Book 3

> Don't waste the rest of your time here worrying about the other people, unless if affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. [...] and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind.

> If you find that there's nothing more important or valuable than that... then don't make room for anything but it, for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours.

> Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too, ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth.

## Book 4

> Everthing you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you've already seen. "The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception."

> Choose not to be harmed - and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed - and you haven't been.

> Beautigul things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Prais is extraneous. The obkect of praise remains what it was - no better and no worse.

> "If you seek tranquility, do less". Or more accurately do what's essential. Which brings double satisfaction: to do less, better.
> Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary?"

> Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow, or the day after. Unless you were a complete coward, you wouldn't kick up a fuss about which day it was - what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.

> To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.

> So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.

## Book 5

> Nothing happens to anyone that he can't endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharme-out of sher obliviousness or because they want to display "character". Is wisdow really so much weaker than ignorance and vanity?

> In a sence, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them.
> But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us - like sun, wind, animals. Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. THe mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. 
> The impediment to action advances action.
> What stand in the way becomes the way.

> Don't be irritated at people's smell or bad breath. What's the point? With that mouth, with those armpits, they're going to produce that odor.
> But they have a brain! Can't they figure it out? Can't they recognize the problem?
> So you have a brain as well. Good for you. Then use your logic to awaken his. Show him. Make him realize it. If he'll listen, then you'll have solved the problem. Without anger.

> Have you gorgotten what's what?
> - I know, but it was important to them.
> And so you have to be an idiot as well?
