# Management 3.0

## Why things are not that simple

#### Casual determinism

One action results to one outcome

#### Complexity theory

There are events like weather that are too hard to guess because there are too many parameters.

#### Reductionism

Cutting a problem into small pieces to be able to explain them one by one. 

Remark: This works well until a certain point: when is the next financial crisis?

#### Holism

A system can't be determined by all its parts alone, the system is the key in the interactions of its parts.

#### Constructionism

A system is the sum of all its underlying parts.

Remark: It's not because you understand all the underlying parts, you can understand why part A fails but not how to prevent it on a global level (eg: the human heart).

#### Hierarchical reductionism

Like Holism, not everything in a complex system can be explained by seeking for lower level causes. Each evel of the system have new properties.

Law of leaky abstractions:
> All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
> _Spolsky_

Theory of constraints:
> Unified models of complex systems are impossible to create

Focus on adaptability not on predictability.

## Agile Software Development

- Passionate about the product
- Be your own customer
- List of features (no plan, be able to stop when you want)
- Growing process

#### Agile manifesto

Individuals & interactions -> process & tools
Working software -> comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration -> contract negociation
Responding to change -> following a plan

## Complex System Theory

Importance of connection dot.

The other option is to have many silo's that reinvent the wheel (eg: biologist, physician, ... don't communicate with each others)

#### General system theory

A phenomenon is viewed as a web of relationships of elements, this requires interdisciplinary skills with a common language.
From elements to a dynamic organization of elements.

#### Cybernetics

Is also cross-discipline.
A system have a goal and interact with the environment through a feedback mechanism from evaluating, iterations, sensing (in a circular way).

#### Dynamica system theory

A system have many states, some are stable and some are not.
When a state never change or go back to its initial state after disturbtion, we call it stable or attractor.

#### Game theory

A system often compete for the same resources where the success of one depends partly on the choices made by others (eg: dating someone).

#### Evolutionary theory

A system adapts to the environment.

#### Chaos theory

Little change in the system can make huge differences later.
This emphasis that the behavior is unpredictable because a minor issue can turn into a major one.

Embrace uncertainty and change.
