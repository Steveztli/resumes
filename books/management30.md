## Why things are not that simple

#### Casual determinism

One action results to one outcome

#### Complexity theory

There are events like weather that are too hard to guess because there are too many parameters.

#### Reductionism

Cutting a problem into small pieces to be able to explain them one by one. 

Remark: This works well until a certain point: when is the next financial crisis?

#### Holism

A system can't be determined by all its parts alone, the system is the key in the interactions of its parts.

#### Constructionism

A system is the sum of all its underlying parts.

Remark: It's not because you understand all the underlying parts, you can understand why part A fails but not how to prevent it on a global level (eg: the human heart).

#### Hierarchical reductionism
