#Mindset

##The mindsets
People with a growth mindset are solution oriented: for every failure, there's a solution that you have to work for. Blaming yourself won't solve anything. They stretch themselves when it's not going well.

Don't judge people on their skill, help them to learn if they need.

>Think about how to stretch/challenge myself

##Inside the mindsets

####Learning from failures

The outcome does not qualify your efforts: fail or success. A failure can turn into a future success, what matters is to not give up after failures.
Learning > the outcome

A fixed mindset transforms an action to an identity `fail → I'm a failure`

Don't deny your mistakes, admit them. That's how you can go forward. Being corrected on a mistake is a way to learn


####Work for it
If there's something that you really want it, you have to work for it and if you work hard enough, you will achieve it.

Never rely on past successes, for example an athlete can get a gold medal once, that doesn not make him having a successful career or life.

When you are sad or feel depressed, the best way to go over it, is to learn something that you always wanted to do and never did, plan it!
> What do I wanna learn and never started?

Avoid being lazy and tired when it becomes to be hard, that's when you learn the most.

####Talent
Some people perform better without any learning but after training everyone can reach and beat the talented people.
With training you can also become better than the well-born and trained ones.


##Praising people 
Praise people for the hard work not for their talent.
Eg: `It's fantastic what you have accomplished by training at this` instead of `Ỳou are so good at this` 

Why? Praising people on their talent make them feel the fear of failing and it leads people to refuses challenges because they do not want to be challenged on their abilities and lose value if they fail the challenge.
Praising people for their hard work, motivate them to work even harder and it removes any judgement on their abilities.

Instead of `He's smarted` say
- `He experienced more`
- `He tried harder`
- `He had a better strategy`
- ...

Business: Mindset and Leadership
Good to great → best leaders admit their errors and are self-effacing, don't undermine, don't take credit.

(check p 110- 112)

People like to use their skills to have fast results, not use new a skill that they need to learn.

People target those they fear (attack competent employees to save your competences)

Don't judge, it destroys innovation and then all that remains is pleasing the boss 

Self-importance → leads to no progress or feedback

Elitism is bad because of all this, mentoring is good

Don't put too much faith in talent → then no discussion and learning happen to lead to no growth

Fixed mindset, group thinking: don't dare to contradict the heroes (publicly)

(check p 141)

Ask specific feedback? Ask/give feedback that promotes learning.

Parents, teachers, and coaches: where do mindsets come from?
Be mindful of your praise to people, don't do on smart, talents,... but on work

People mimic behavior even from a young age, pay attention to your words

Success is not coming to you, you must come to it

Show people their progress in learning, see learning as a plain field where you need to build a city → gamification (question)

Don't judge on the talent

(Check p 202 & 204)

To pass the growth mindset:

Learn from failures
Praise hard process
deepening understanding
