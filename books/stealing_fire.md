## Why it matters

The content of the altered states can vary but they all have 4 elements in common: STER (Selflessness, Timelessness, Effortlessness and Richness).

People who experience altered stats feels many positive impact among feeling better, feeling boosted, valueing experiences more than products and so on...

#### Selflessness

Prefrontal Cortex turned us into a more civilized species and made us aware of the self which also resulted in many down sides like anxiety, depression, anger, jaleousy and so on.
All the altered states companies are there to make us forget that little voice inside us.

Being in an altered state makes that little voice inside shutting down and we can look at events without judging them from our past experiences.
We stop from _being subject to become object_ to win more flexibility and at complex systems not only from your point of view but also from other perspectives. Being seen as an object makes us able to leave our packaging and see at who we are and what we are showing of ourself.

#### Timelessness

We are so focus on our past and future that we forget the present, we often even forget that there's a present and it goes so fast because we are never living in the moment.
In an altered state, there's only the present and our brains stop filtering out, we see more, we hear more, we feel more and that makes the present look longer.

Time enslaves us and make us think about future and past (calendar, timer, meetings, ...)

> Me: Is it why some famous doesn't believe in time like Oprah Winfrey?

#### Effortlessness

According to many studies people have healthy food available but they are more and more fat, we have a better work life balance than in the previous generations but we still mostly all feel unmotivated at work. We sometimes try to make effort to fix those but we barely succeed.

People who experience the altered state are able to leave everything behind (products, jobs, health,...) to feel it more and more because it is easy and very pleasurable to experience.

#### Richness

In altered state, our brain does not filter out most of the data that we get. We can process more, we can make new connections and be more disruptive in the way we think.

#### Summary

They have made huge research about this and found out:
1. Creativity is super important
2. We fail at training creativity because it's not a skill but a mindset

Wicked problems like: war, traffic and poverty can't be fixed using ou casual way of fixing problems, using that casual way leads to fixing a symptom and creating another one.
For exampling, adding lanes to a high way to have less traffic jam results in having more cars and more traffic jam.

To solve big problems we need to _opposable mind approach_, we need to address opposite views and be able to see from different perspectives.
Using the simple either/or logic does not work.


Simple exercise, try connecting the 9 dots using 4 lines without lifting the pencil.

```

The study showed that only 5% of people can solve it, the rate goes up to 40% when people are trained to experience alternate state.

Wicked question requires us tp be disruptive to find new solution to complex problems.

Being trained to experience the alternate state boost 3 important skills:
- 200% more creative
- 490% faster learning
- 500% more productive 

There are 3 way to train us to experience more the alternate state:
- Meditation
- Technological simulation
- Drugs
  
## Why we missed it

There are 3 main entities that keep us not exploring the altered states:
- Religion, by refusing to people to find a connection to the us outside of the Church. 
- Body, by being afraid of what is not natural that could have bad impact on us.
- State, by deciding which products are legal and illegal.

There are reasons why those entities (pale) exists, because this state is a double edge sword and it is good that they prevent it.

We are in danger or losing too much of ourselves. Our cherished rational individualism risks to be over-run by the power of the irrational collectivism. 

Many examples exist throug history on this: Nazi, Communism, Charles Manson and many more...
