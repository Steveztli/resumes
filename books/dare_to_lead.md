# Dare to lead

## Introduction

Definition of a leader
```
Anyone who takes responsability for finding the potential in people and processes, 
and who has the courage to develop that potential
```

When writing, always keep in mind to `write what you need to read`

What stands in the way of becoming a leader:
* Avoiding though conversations, giving honest and productive feedback
* Not actively addressing fears and feelings that show up during change
* Diminishing trust caused by lack of connections and empathy
* Not taking smart risks or creating and sharing bold ideas to innovate
* Being defined by setbacks, disappointements and failures
* Too much shame and blame
* Fear to say something wrong
* Rushing into ineffective solutions instead of problem identification and solving.
* Organizational values that can't be taught, measured, and evaluated.
* Perfectionism and fear of letting people grow

## Part 1 - Rumbling with vulnerability

People who aren't getting their asses kicked in the arena on occasion, I'm not interested in or open to your feedback. There are plenty of people who will never be brave but who will spend all their energy judging those who dare greatly.

### Rumble tool

Get a one inch by one inch piece of paper and write down the names of the people whose opinions of you matter. Keep that list and take some time to share some gratitude to them, they are your `square squad`.
Those people should love you for your imperfections and vulnerability, don't take 'yes' people, take people that respect you enough to give you productive and honest feedback.
