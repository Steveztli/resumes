# Google: Project Aristotle

## Project Aristotle

Companies are made up of great teams.
It's on thing to hire a bunch of rockstars, but it's a completely different thing to get those stars to work together. 

Google studied 180 teams, doing interviews with executives, team leads and team members.

They concluded the research by isolating specific factors that influenced team effectiveness, the main one being psychological safety.

### Psychological safety

Risk taking is seeing as safe, there's no fear of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative or disruptive.
A member of the team should feel confident that he will not be punished for asking a question or offering a new idea.

#### How to increase it?

##### Approach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary.
As human we hate losing even more than winning.
A perceived loss triggers attempts to reestablish fairness through competition, criticism, or disengagement.
>"How could we achieve a mutually desirable outcome?" 

##### Speak human to human

Understand that every human needs respect, competence, social status and autonomy. Everyone wants to do good.

Reflect on this:
- This person has beliefs, perspectives, and opinions, just like me.
- This person has hopes, anxieties, and vulnerabilities, just like me.
- This person has friends, family, and perhaps children who love them, just like me.
- This person wants to feel respected, appreciated, and competent, just like me.
- This person wishes for peace, joy, and happiness, just like me.

##### Anticipate reactions and plan countermoves

Skillfully confront difficult conversations head-on by preparing for likely reactions.

- What are my main points?
- What are three ways my listeners are likely to respond?
- How will I respond to each of those scenarios?

##### Replace blame with curiosity

Research shows that blame and criticism reliably escalate conflict, leading to defensiveness and (eventually) to disengagement.

If you believe you already know what the other person is thinking, then you’re not ready to have a conversation. Instead, adopt a learning mindset, knowing you don’t have all the facts.

- State the problem
- Explore with them the causes
- Find a solution that they can work on and buy in, support them.

##### Ask for feedback on delivery

What worked and what didn’t work in my delivery?
How did it feel to hear this message?
How could I have presented it more effectively?

##### Measure psychological safety

Regularly ask:
- How psyschologicaly safe do you feel?
- What can we do to enhance it?

### Dependability

Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?

### Structure & clarity

Are goals, roles, and executions plans on our team clear?

### Meaning of work

Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?

### Impact of work

Do we fundamentally believe that the work we're doing matters.

## How to be a better team

Listen more, talk less
Praise generously
Reframe negative feedback
Pay attention to your team mates' emotions
